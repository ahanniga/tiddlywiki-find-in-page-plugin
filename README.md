# tiddlywiki-find-in-page-plugin

This simulates the "Find-in-Page" browser function for [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [Tiddly Desktop](https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyDesktop/) wikis. It works fine on single-file wikis too.

This code is based on the [Highlight Searched Text plugin](https://github.com/bimlas/tw5-highlight-searched-text) by [bimlas](https://github.com/bimlas), but with incremental searching similar to the way the browser behaves.

## Demo and Installation

Try out and install the plugin from here https://tiddlywiki-find-in-page-plugin.tiddlyhost.com/.

## Build from Source

Build the documentation wiki with `make`.

```
make install
make
```

Then open `index.html` in your browser.
